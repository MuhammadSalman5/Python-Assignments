    "OOP\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets\n",
    "Principles of OOP\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is based on the following principles:\n",
    "•\tEncapsulation- The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined boundary, or class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes but are only able to call a list of public functions, or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.\n",
    "•\tAbstraction- Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. This concept helps developers make changes and additions over time more easily.\n",
    "•\tInheritance- Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, allowing developers to reuse a common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.\n",
    "•\tPolymorphism- Objects are allowed to take on more than one form depending on the context. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object, cutting down on the need to duplicate code.\n"

    "Benefits of Object Oriented Programming Language \n",
    "•\tThe programmes written with OOP are really easy to understand.\n",
    "•\tSince everything is treated as objects, so we can model a real-world concept using OOP.\n",
    "•\tOOP approach offers the reusability of classes. We can reuse the classes that are already created without writing them again and again.\n",
    "•\tSince the parallel development of classes is possible in OOP concept, It results in the quick development of the complete programmes.\n",
    "•\tProgrammes written in OOP technique are marginally easier to test, manage as well as maintain.\n",
    "•\tIt is a secured development technique since data is hidden and can’t be accessed by external functions.\n"

    "Difference between method and function\n",
    "1.\tSimply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key difference is the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘.\n",
    "2.\tFunctions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Class\n",
    "The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. Classes are used to create and manage new objects and support inheritance—a key ingredient in object-oriented programming and a mechanism of reusing code.\n",
    "Object\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. \n",
    "Attribute\n",
    "In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance.\n",
    "Behavior\n",
    "A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n",
